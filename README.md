## Code to accompany *[Classification of joint quantum measurements based on entanglement cost of localization](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.XXXXX)*
#### Jef Pauwels, Alejandro Pozas-Kerstjens, Flavio del Santo, and Nicolas Gisin

This is a repository containing the computational appendix of the article "*Classification of joint quantum measurements based on entanglement cost of localization*. Jef Pauwels, Alejandro Pozas-Kerstjens, Flavio del Santo, and Nicolas Gisin. [arXiv:2408.XXXXX](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.XXXXX)." It provides the codes for analytically solving the initial levels in the hierarchies for localizing joint two-qubit measurements, and for exploring higher levels and the three-qubit scenario. It also contains all the measurements found by numerical searches, for the third level of the hierarchy in the two-qubit scenario, and for the first two levels in the three-qubit scenario.

The code is written in Mathematica and MATLAB.
